# üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ chicago-community-area-ward-demographics

Discover how demographics in your Chicago neighborhood break down by ward.

## What's this?

This repository contains configurable scripts to generate demographic data
from the intersection of Chicago community areas and overlapping wards.

These scripts were developed in support of the **Hermosa Neighborhood
Association**, so they default to calculating the total population of Hermosa
broken down by ward using 5-year estimates from the 2017 [American Community
Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html).

You can view the generated dataset [here](finished/population_by_ward.csv). You
can also customize the scripts to retrieve different demographics for other
community areas and wards using [the instructions below](#-customize-the-scripts).

## Run the scripts yourself

### Requirements

- [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
    - Included in Docker Desktop on Mac/PC, requires install on Linux

### Setup

Navigate in your terminal to the directory in which you'd like this code to
live, then clone and `cd` into this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datamade/chicago-community-area-ward-demographics.git && cd chicago-community-area-ward-demographics
```

### Usage

#### üîë Get an API key

To retrieve data, first [get a Census API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

When your key is activated, make a working copy of the secrets file by running
this command in your terminal:

```bash
cp scripts/secrets.py.example scripts/secrets.py
```

Open the new file in your favorite text editor and replace `YOUR API KEY` with -
what else? - your API key.

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Make the default data afresh

**To remove and remake the default data**, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
make clean && docker-compose run --rm data
```

#### üîç Customize the scripts

**To retrieve additional tables** from the American Community Survey, consult
the ACS variable definition [here](https://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs5/variables.html).
Once you've identified which tables you'd like, update the value of `ACS_TABLES`
in [line 17 of `docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml#L17). To retrieve
multiple tables, separate them with commas, e.g., `B01001B_005E,B01001B_006E`.

**To retrieve information for a different community area and wards**, update
the values of `COMMUNITY_AREA` and `WARDS` in [lines 15 and 16 of `docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml#L15-16).
Be sure to enclose your community area in quotes if it contains a space, e.g.,
`"Humboldt Park"`.

Once you've made your changes, refresh the data by running the following
command in your terminal:

```bash
make clean && docker-compose run --rm data
```

## Loose ends

Right now, you need to know your community area and the wards it overlaps to use
these scripts. It'd be great if you could plug in a community area and these
scripts would discover the overlapping wards for you!
